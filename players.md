Score: 0 points.

## Rationale

* I play to better understand the legislative process. I'm interested in systems of rules and systems of self-amendment; I want to see where we can move the rules to.

    I consent to the rules. If I can no longer consent to the rules, I will withdraw.

## Platform

* The 200 point condition is a token nod towards traditional game structures, where "victory" is assumed to be a primary motivator for player behaviour. I believe we do no need it; if we want "victory" as a condition, we should choose its structure for ourselves, rather than relying on one set out in the initial ruleset.

    Repeal rule 208, 206, 204, the points clause of rule 201, and rule 112. Impose, as a temporary measure, a rule that obliterates existing scores, then repeal it.

    (For myself, I think "victory" is a bad motivator and encourages degenerate gameplay goals. I believe the game should - will, naturally - end when it no longer has anything to teach us and no longer has interesting scenarios to resolve, not when someone beats it.)

* Strict, sequential play order is not appropriate for an asynchronous, distributed game. We may still need a system for ensuring every player is heard, but I believe that enforcing strict synchronization will rapidly erode players' patience for the game.

    I propose a system of sessions, to be elaborated.

* Organizing the rules by number, and numbering the rule by proposal sequence, renders the rules hard to follow and unpleasant to interpret. We'll likely survive this in the short term, but I believe it to be worth addressing once more immediate concerns are addressed.

    We should empower someone (possibly a rolling position or office) to organize the rules into a more digestible form.
